\title{Takes a GRanges object and left/right exons to compute matches.
i.e takes the pos_exons (GRanges) and left and right exons and returns
a tibble that is the same as pos_exons but with two additional columns
'match_left' and 'match_right' indicating whether each exon matches the left
and right exons respectively. The matching is done based on the 'type'
parameter which can be "in", "over", or "boundary".}
\usage{
compute_matches(gr, left_exon, right_exon, type = c("in", "over", "boundary"))
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A GRanges object with exon annotations}

\item{left_exon}{A GRanges object with left exon(s) to match}

\item{right_exon}{A GRanges object with right exon(s) to match}

\item{type}{The type of overlap to consider when identifying matches.}
}
\value{
A tibble created from gr with two additional columns:
'match_left' and 'match_right' indicating the number of overlaps with
the left and right exons, respectively.
}
